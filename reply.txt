Example 1: https://godbolt.org/z/PT6ssxdv1 (Taken from Message-ID:
<20210614153545.GA68749@worktop.programming.kicks-ass.net>) where counter
updates look like "inc qword ptr [rip + .L__profc_instr(int)]".

Example 2 with MC/DC: https://godbolt.org/z/ronMc578z where bitmap updates
look like "or byte ptr [rip + .L__profbm_instr(int)], 8".

In both two examples the compiler is respecting
"__no_profile_instrument_function__" attribute, which is part of
"__no_profile" macro, which is in turn part of "noinstr" macro.

Allow me to reformat Steve's <steven.h.vanderleest@boeing.com> reply below:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I'll answer Peter's last question: "What is the impact on certification
  of not covering the noinstr code."
 
  Any code in the target image that is not executed by a test (and thus not
  covered) must be analyzed and justified as an exception. For example,
  defensive code is often impossible to exercise by test, but can be
  included in the image with a justification to the regulatory authority
  such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In practice, this
  means the number of unique instances of non-instrumented code needs to be
  manageable.  I say "unique instances" because there may be many instances
  of a particular category, but justified by the same analysis/rationale.
  Where we specifically mark a section of code with noinstr, it is
  typically because the instrumentation would change the behavior of the
  code, perturbing the test results. With some analysis for each distinct
  category of this issue, we could then write justification(s) to show
  the overall coverage is sufficient.
 
  Regards,
  Steve
